<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>bstractâ€” Robots today can exploit the rich world knowledgeof large language models to chain simple behavioral skillsinto long-horizon tasks. 
  However, robots often get interruptedduring long-horizon tasks due to primitive skill failures anddynamic environments. We propose VADER, aplan, 
  execute,detectframework withseeking helpas a new skill that enablesrobots to recover and complete long-horizon tasks with the helpof humans or other 
  robots. VADER leverages visual questionanswering (VQA) modules to detectvisual affordancesandrecognizeexecution errors. 
  It then generates prompts for alanguage model planner (LMP) which decides when to seek helpfrom another robot or human torecover 
  from errorsin long-horizon task execution. We show the effectiveness of VADERthrough an experiment with a mobile manipulator asking forhelp from 
  another mobile manipulator or another human forcompleting two long-horizon robotic tasks. Our user study with19 participants suggests VADER is 
  perceived to complete tasksmore successfully than a control which does not ask for help, yetVADER is perceived as equally capable even though it 
  receiveshuman help.</p>
